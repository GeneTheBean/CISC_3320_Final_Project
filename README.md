CISC 3320, Operating Systems Final Project, Professor Jacquiline Jones

[Project Description] http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~jones/cisc3320/sospage.html
"The project is a simulation of an operating system. Your program works together with an existing program SOS) that 
simulates a job stream. SOS feeds your program a series of jobs and job requests; like a real operating system, your 
program must field those requests and handle the life cycle of each of the jobs, from system entry to termination."
